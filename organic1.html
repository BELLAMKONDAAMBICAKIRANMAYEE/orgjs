                    <h3>FOOD</h3>
                    <p class="more">
                        Food is at the heart of many of the world’s environmental, social and economic challenges. The issues – from soil health to public health – are complex and cannot be solved in isolation. As it stands, the way we produce and consume food is pushing the planet and its systems to the limit.
                        
                        So how do we ensure enough safe, nutritious food for everyone, and food that’s produced sustainably and affordably? We call this sustainable nutrition - an approach that optimises health and nutritional outcomes whilst restoring the key ecosystems and farming livelihoods on which we depend.
                        
                        Our vision? Simply put, by 2030 we want to have catalysed a new system in which food is produced and consumed in a way that is affordable, healthy and good for the planet.</p>
                        
                        <h3>What are our goals?</h3>
                        <p class="more">   To ensure that sustainable diets are the norm with more fruit, veg and plant-based proteins
                        To radically reduce food waste across the system
                        To fast track the ability of the food industry to deliver sustainable nutrition outcomes
                        To make regenerative, resilient agriculture the mainstream</p>
